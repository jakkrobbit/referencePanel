# Photoshop Reference Panel v1.0.0 #

If you need to use reference images for a drawing in Photoshop and don't have dual-monitors or a fairly large desktop set up, you may end up doing one of 3 things:
- Open Photoshop and the browser window side-by-side
- Open the image in PS and have 2 PS windows open side-by-side
- Paste the image in the PS document on its own layer and delete it when done

I got tired of working this way and realized it would be easier if I could just have images open in a separate panel. Reference Panel is a Photoshop CC extension for holding reference images while you work. Drag-and-drop, copy-and-paste, or open files the old-fashion way and the images will stay in the panel. No need to resize the Photoshop window or needlessly add another layer to what may already be a very large project.

Compatible with Photoshop CC 2015 and newer.
